This repo contains implementation of K Means clustering algorithm in C. 

K Means Clustering:
K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning, which is used when you have unlabeled data (i.e., data without defined categories or groups). \n The goal of this algorithm is to find groups in the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable K.

This is implmentation for 5 clusters (i-e k = 5).
Input  data is k_input.csv.
Code is written in main.c file.
