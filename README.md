This repo contains implementation of K Means clustering algorithm in C. 

K Means Clustering:
K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning, which is used when you have unlabeled data (i.e., data without defined categories or groups). \ The goal of this algorithm is to find groups in the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable K.
